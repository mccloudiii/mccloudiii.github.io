# Ansible vs Python for Network Automation: Which One Should You Choose?

Network automation is becoming an essential practice for modern IT operations. As networks grow in complexity, automating tasks ensures efficiency, consistency, and scalability. Among the popular tools for network automation, Ansible and Python often come up in discussions. This post will explore the strengths and differences of both, helping you decide which is better suited for your needs.

## Ansible for Network Automation

### What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that uses a simple, declarative language called YAML. It allows you to automate network configurations, deployments, and other administrative tasks without the need for complex scripting.
### Key Features of Ansible

| Feature         | Description                                                                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Agentless       | Ansible doesn’t require any agent software on <br>the devices it manages. This reduces overhead and simplifies the setup. |
| Playbooks       | Tasks are defined in playbooks, which are easy-to-read YAML files.                                |
| Idempotency     | Ansible ensures that tasks are applied consistently without causing <br>unintended changes, even if run multiple times. |
| Broad Support   | Ansible supports a wide range of devices and platforms, including Cisco, Juniper,<br> Arista, and more. |

### Cons of Using Ansible

| Cons                          | Description                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Less Flexibility              | While Ansible is great for predefined tasks,<br> it may lack the flexibility required for more complex, custom automation. |
| Learning Curve for Advanced Features | Although basic tasks are easy,<br> mastering advanced features and custom modules can take time.      |


## Python for Network Automation

### What is Python?

Python is a powerful, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in network automation to create custom scripts and integrate with various libraries and APIs.
### Key Features of Python

| Feature              | Description                                                                                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Versatility          | Python can be used for almost any automation task, <br>from simple configuration changes to complex integrations. |
| Rich Library Ecosystem | Python has numerous libraries for network automation,<br> such as Netmiko, Nornir, Paramiko, and Napalm. |
| Customizability      | With Python, you have full control over the automation logic,<br> allowing for highly customized solutions. |

## Choosing Between Ansible and Python

### When to Use Ansible

- **You Need Quick Setup**: Ansible is ideal for those who want to get started quickly with automation without delving deep into programming.
- **Standardized Tasks**: If your tasks are routine and follow a standard pattern, Ansible's declarative approach is highly effective.
- **Large-Scale Deployments**: Ansible excels in managing large numbers of devices with minimal overhead.

### When to Use Python

- **Custom Automation**: For complex tasks that require custom logic, Python's flexibility is unmatched.
- **Advanced Integrations**: If your automation needs to interact with various systems and APIs, Python is the better choice.
- **Learning and Development**: If you're looking to develop broader programming skills while automating networks, Python offers more depth.

## Coding Examples: Ansible vs. Python with Netmiko

### Ansible Playbook Example

```yaml
- name: Configure Network Devices
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Run show version command
      ios_command:
        commands:
          - show version
      register: output

    - name: Display output
      debug:
        var: output.stdout_lines
```

### Python with Netmiko Example

```python
from netmiko import ConnectHandler

# Device details
device = {
    'device_type': 'cisco_ios',
    'host': '192.168.1.1',
    'username': 'admin',
    'password': 'password',
}

# Connect to the device
net_connect = ConnectHandler(**device)

# Execute command
output = net_connect.send_command('show version')

# Print the output
print(output)

# Disconnect
net_connect.disconnect()
```

## Conclusion

Both Ansible and Python are powerful tools for network automation, each with its unique strengths. Ansible is great for quick, standardized automation with minimal setup, while Python offers unparalleled flexibility for custom and complex tasks. Your choice will depend on your specific needs, the complexity of your network environment, and your willingness to dive into programming.

Additionally, Python's ecosystem includes libraries like Netmiko, which simplifies SSH management for network devices, and Nornir, which offers a framework for orchestrating complex network automation tasks. These tools, combined with Python's flexibility, make it a strong contender for those seeking highly customizable solutions.

Whichever tool you choose, adopting network automation is a step towards more efficient, reliable, and scalable network management. Happy automating!
